# Windrose - More Ring and Necklace Slots - Existing Character Patcher - v1.0

**This is not a mod. This is a tool for patching your existing Windrose characters to work with the existing Nexus mod [More Ring and Necklace Slots](https://www.nexusmods.com/windrose/mods/350) mod by Baradrim, so you don't need to make a new character to use the mod.**

If you are creating a new character with the mod install, you do not need this patcher.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have [More Ring and Necklace Slots mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/windrose/mods/350) by Baradrim installed. You can double check that it is working by creating a new character, and checking in the tutorial to see if you have the extra slots.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you **create a backup of your save folder**. Scroll down to see how. 
>
> Windrose is constantly updating and mods and tooling usually lag behind. Ensure you are taking the best steps to protect your saves.

## How to Use
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must *temporarily disable Steam Cloud Sync* for Windrose before relaunching the game. When you launch the game, Steam pulls your old save from the cloud and overwrites the new patched save. You can and should re-enable it after you verify the patcher has worked.
>
> In **Steam** → right-click Windrose → Properties → General → uncheck *"Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud"*.
>
> If Steam asks about a conflict, pick "Use Local files".

> [!NOTE]
> When the patcher asks for ring and necklace slot counts, enter values that **match the mod variant you installed** from Nexus (for example: 2 ring + 2 necklace, 4 ring + 4 necklace, or another combination offered by the mod).

### Running the patcher

2. Disable Steam Cloud Sync.<br/>In Steam → right-click Windrose → Properties → General → uncheck "Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud".
3. Run the patcher and follow the instructions

5. Close the game and re-enable Steam Cloud Sync

I apologize if Chrome, Windows Defender, or your Antivirus flags the file as a virus. This is just the nature of all unsigned *.exe files. If this is not acceptable for you, consider building from source yourself.

# FAQs

## How to backup my saves?
Your saves can be found at  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\R5\Saved\SaveProfiles\<STEAM_ID>\`

I would create copies of the ``RocksDB_v2`` and ``RocksDB_v2_Backups`` folders. Note that Steam Cloud Sync modifies these folders, so keep your backups OUTSIDE of SavedProfiles.

## How do I disable Steam Cloud Saves?
In **Steam** → right-click Windrose → Properties → General → uncheck *"Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud"

Note that after applying the patch, **launching the game**, and verifying that you see your slots, you should **re-enable Steam Cloud Saves**.

## How do I report a bug
If you have discovered any bugs, feel free to leave an issue here on [GitHiub](https://github.com/DeveloperBlue/windrose-mrns-existing-character-patcher/issues) or send an email over to ``contact@michaelrooplall.com``.

## Undoing the patch

If you want to "undo" the patcher and remove the extra slots:
- Follow the "How to Use" section again, and specify "1" for the number of ring and necklace slots.
- Also remove the nexus mod if you don't want it to apply to future characters.
