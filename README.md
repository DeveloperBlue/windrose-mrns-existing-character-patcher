# Windrose - More Ring and Necklace Slots - Existing Character Patcher - v1.0

**This is not a mod. This is a tool for patching your existing Windrose characters to work with the existing Nexus mod [More Ring and Necklace Slots](https://www.nexusmods.com/windrose/mods/350) mod by Baradrim, so you don't need to make a new character to use the mod**

If you are creating a new character with the mod install, you do not need this patcher.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have [More Ring and Necklace Slots mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/windrose/mods/350) by Baradrim installed. You can double check that it is working by creating a new character, and checking in the tutorial to see if you have the extra slots.

## How to Use

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you **create a backup of your save folder**. 
> Your saves can be found at  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\R5\Saved\SaveProfiles\<STEAM_ID>\`, speficically the ``RocksDB_v2`` and ``RocksDB_v2_Backups`` folders.
> Windrose is constantly updating and mods and tooling usually lag behind. Ensure you are taking the best steps to protect your saves.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must *temporarily* disable Steam Cloud Sync for Windrose before relaunching the game. When you launch the game, Steam pulls your old save from the cloud and overwrites the new patched save. You can and should re-enable it after you verify the patcher has worked.
> To disable: **Steam** → right-click Windrose → Properties → General → uncheck *"Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud"*.
> If Steam asks about a conflict, pick "Use Local files".

**Running the patcher**

1. Download the latest version of the patcher from [releases](https://github.com/DeveloperBlue/windrose-mrns-existing-character-patcher/releases)
1. Disable Steam Cloud Sync
2. Run it and follow the instructions
3. Launch the game and verify that you have the extra slots
4. Close the game and re-enable Steam Cloud Sync

I apologize if Chrome, Windows Defender, or your Antivirus flags the file as a virus. This is just the nature of all unsigned *.exe files. If this is not acceptable for you, consider building from source yourself.
